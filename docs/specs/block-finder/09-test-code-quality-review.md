# Review and improve test code quality for block-finder

## Context

After implementing all tests for the block finder component, the test code should be reviewed and refactored for clarity, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.

## Current Behavior

Test code will exist but may have duplication, unclear assertions, or poor organization.

## Expected Behavior

- Test code is refactored to eliminate duplication
- Test helpers and utilities are extracted where appropriate
- Test descriptions clearly explain what is being tested
- Test setup and teardown are properly organized
- Test data and fixtures are well-structured
- Tests follow consistent patterns and naming conventions
- DO NOT modify production code during this task

## Required Context

- All implemented test files for block finder
- Testing best practices from the codebase
- Existing test patterns in the project

## Blocking Issues

- All block finder tests must be implemented first
