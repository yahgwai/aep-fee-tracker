# Review and improve code quality for block-finder

## Context

After implementing the block finder component, the production code should be reviewed and refactored for clarity, maintainability, and adherence to project standards.

## Current Behavior

Production code will exist but may have areas for improvement in terms of clarity, organization, or adherence to patterns.

## Expected Behavior

- Production code is refactored to improve readability
- Complex logic is simplified where possible
- Code follows established patterns from the codebase
- Constants are properly extracted and named
- Functions are appropriately sized and focused
- Code organization follows project conventions
- DO NOT modify test code during this task

## Required Context

- All implemented block finder source files
- Existing code patterns from FileManager and other components
- Architecture principles from `/workspace/docs/architecture.md`

## Blocking Issues

- Block finder implementation must be complete
- All tests must be passing
