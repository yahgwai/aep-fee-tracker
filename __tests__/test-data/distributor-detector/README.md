# Distributor Detector Test Data

This directory contains test data files used by the distributor detector test suite. All data is derived from real Arbitrum Nova blockchain events to ensure accurate testing.

## Files

### distributor-creation-events-raw.json

Raw distributor creation events captured from Arbitrum Nova blockchain. Contains:

- **Event Count**: 6 distributor creation events
- **Block Range**: Blocks 152 to 3163115
- **Time Period**: July 12, 2022 to March 16, 2023
- **Event Types**: L2_BASE_FEE, L2_SURPLUS_FEE, L1_SURPLUS_FEE distributor creations

Each event includes:

- Block number and timestamp
- Transaction hash and indices
- Event topics and data
- Method selector identifying distributor type

### block_numbers.json

Block timestamp mappings generated by BlockFinder for date-based lookups. Contains:

- **Chain ID**: 42170 (Arbitrum Nova)
- **Date Coverage**: Includes dates before, on, and after each test event
- **Purpose**: Maps calendar dates to end-of-day block numbers

Generated using BlockFinder to ensure consistency with production data formats.

### reward-distributor-bytecode.json

Reference bytecode for the reward distributor contract. Contains:

- **Contract**: RewardDistributor implementation
- **Format**: Deployed bytecode (not creation bytecode)
- **Usage**: Verifying deployed distributor contracts match expected implementation

## Data Sources

All test data is sourced from:

- **Network**: Arbitrum Nova (Chain ID: 42170)
- **RPC Endpoint**: https://nova.arbitrum.io/rpc
- **Contracts**:
  - ArbOwner: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000070
  - Distributor addresses: Various (see events file)

## Maintenance

When adding new test cases:

1. Ensure event data matches actual blockchain state
2. Update block_numbers.json if new date ranges are needed
3. Verify bytecode if testing new distributor implementations
